# Basic DENO APP
Basic DENO app, CRUD oriented with no javascript on the client-side.  
As you may know, html5 only supports GET and POST methods, so a real CRUD app is not possible without javascript on the client-side.  
That's why this app is CRUD oriented and it's not a real CRUD app.

 - install [denon](https://deno.land/x/denon@2.4.4) (nodemon for deno)
